        <!-- Lets add an image -->
        <!-- Be sure to add the alt tag for those screen readers -->

            <!-- Image external to the website -->

            <!-- External image inside an anchor tag so the image is the link -->


    <!-- Here we can put any footer content we want -->

    <!-- A Js link can also be placed here - in fact this is the best place to put it -->
